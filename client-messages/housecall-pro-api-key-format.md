# HouseCall Pro API Key Format Issue

## Email Message for Client

**Subject:** HouseCall Pro API Key Format - Action Required

---

Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for providing the HouseCall Pro API key for your Claude Business Partner integration.

Unfortunately, we've encountered an issue with the API key format you provided. The key doesn't appear to be in the expected format for HouseCall Pro's API authentication.

**What we need:**

HouseCall Pro API keys typically follow one of these formats:
- `hcp_live_[alphanumeric_string]` (for production)
- `hcp_test_[alphanumeric_string]` (for testing)
- Or a standard bearer token format

**What to do next:**

1. **Double-check the API key** - Please verify you copied the complete key without any extra spaces or characters
2. **Check the source** - Ensure you're copying from the correct location in your HouseCall Pro dashboard
3. **API Access Level** - Verify your HouseCall Pro account has API access enabled

**Where to find your API key:**
1. Log into your HouseCall Pro account
2. Go to Settings → Integrations → API
3. Look for "API Key" or "Access Token"
4. Copy the entire key including any prefixes

**Alternative options:**
- If you don't see an API section in your HouseCall Pro dashboard, you may need to contact HouseCall Pro support to enable API access for your account
- Some accounts require upgrading to a specific plan tier for API access

Could you please re-check and resend the API key? If you continue to have issues locating it, I'd be happy to help you contact HouseCall Pro support to get this resolved.

Once we have the correct API key, your Claude Business Partner will be able to:
- Access your daily schedule and job information
- Provide real-time updates on customer appointments
- Optimize routes and manage follow-up tasks
- Sync customer data for personalized service

Thanks for your patience, and please let me know if you have any questions!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
